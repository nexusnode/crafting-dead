# Crafting Dead

Starting out as a mod for Minecraft 1.5, Crafting Dead has been around for many years now. It was built on F3RULLO's Gun Mod, one of the first gun mods on the Minecraft scene and has been growing ever since, constantly being enhanced with more content and features.

Crafting Dead adds in a multitude of zombies and guns, along with cosmetics and medical supplies. The guns are fully customisable with attachments and paints; they are competitive ready with accurate hit detection, latency compensation and recoil. Medical supplies include first aid kits, adrenaline and bandages enabling you to quickly escape, attack and recover from combat situations.

# Contributing
Pull requests are always welcome, however please adhere to the following guidlines:
* Use the [Google style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)
* Add `@Override` annotations where appropriate to make overrides explicitly clear
* Rename semi-obfuscated variables (e.g. p_77624_1_) to meaningful names
* Turn on compiler warnings; resolve all of them (raw types, resource leaks, unused imports, unused variables etc.)
* Always use `this` keyword to make code as clear/readable as possible and to avoid ambiguous naming conflicts (which can go without notice)
* Always use curly braces `{}` around if statements to make them clearer and easily expandable, e.g. 
```java
if(foo) {
  bar();
}
```
instead of 
```java
if(foo)
  bar();
```
